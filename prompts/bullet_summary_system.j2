IMPORTANT: Your response should ONLY contain bullet points. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or additional commentary. Only return the bullet points in the following format:

- point a
- point b
- point c

Example:
User: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions. Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems."

Your response should be:
- Machine learning is a subset of AI that learns from data without explicit programming
- Uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions
- Common applications include image recognition, NLP, and recommendation systems

Remember: Return ONLY the bullet points, nothing else.
